# VR Annotation and Pointer Placement System for Education and Industrial Training
This project aims to provide a virtual reality (VR) application that enables free annotation and pointer placement for educational and industrial training purposes. The application is designed specifically for the Oculus Quest platform and developed using Unity and Blender. It incorporates custom scripts to enable intuitive interaction through pinching gestures and supports writing annotations directly in VR.




Features


The VR Annotation and Pointer Placement System offers the following key features:

Free Annotation: Users can create annotations directly in the virtual environment by writing or drawing with their hand controllers.
Pointer Placement: The application allows users to place virtual pointers in the scene, facilitating explanations and highlighting specific objects or areas of interest.
Intuitive Interaction: Custom scripts are implemented to enable natural interaction through pinching gestures, providing a more immersive and user-friendly experience.
Oculus Quest Support: The application is specifically developed for the Oculus Quest platform, taking advantage of its standalone VR capabilities.
Unity Integration: The project utilizes Unity as the primary development tool, leveraging its extensive features and VR support.
Blender Integration: Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and animation software, is used to create and modify 3D assets for the VR environment.
Educational and Industrial Training Focus: The system is designed to cater to the needs of educational institutions and industrial training programs, offering a versatile tool for immersive learning and skill development.
